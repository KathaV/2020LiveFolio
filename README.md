## Explanation of the Game
Walk through the rooms of this house, and enter a musical dream! This game was made in 2020 for Harry Tran's 'Live Folio'. In order to experience his music in an interactive and immersive manner, the game creates a gallery-like environment, where each room plays one of his room-themed musical compositions as a centre-piece.

## Game Mechanics
Mechanics are explained at the opening screen, and can be pulled up again through the main menu.


## User Interface
Menu Screen, instructions, and credits, as designed by Elizabeth Ta.

## Modelling Objects and Entities
All shaders, models, and textures were sourced from free third-party assets.
